# A CSS-JS Playground

Welcome to Websdeck. I just wanted to create something with my text editor, so I created Websdeck, a CSS Playground. Websdeck is a simple project inspired by CSSDeck but in a lighter version. You will only find HTML, CSS, Javascript fields and a results panel. But so far, Websdeck is reliable enough to just play with CSS and JS.
